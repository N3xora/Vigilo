          <p>
            {brand.name} ({brand.legalName}) is a security and compliance
            scanner. You submit a URL; we run a series of passive and, where
            authorized, active checks against it and produce a report. This
            policy covers the personal data we collect from you as a user of
            the service, and separately, how we handle data belonging to the
            sites we scan.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section className="space-y-2">
          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">Data we collect from you</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>
              <strong>Email address</strong> — required to submit a scan or
              create an account, used to identify your account. Scan results
              are shown in the report on screen; we do not currently email
              them.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Account and authentication data</strong> — if you sign
              in, our authentication provider (Clerk) manages your
              credentials; we store the resulting account identifier, not
              your password.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Submitted target URLs</strong> — the sites you ask us
              to scan, and the reports we generate from those scans.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Billing information</strong> — if you subscribe to a
              paid plan, payment details are collected and processed
              directly by our merchant-of-record payment provider; we
              receive only your subscription status and plan, never your
              card details.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Operational logs</strong> — standard request logs and
              an audit trail of authorization decisions (what was scanned,
              at what tier, and why), kept for security and debugging.
            </li>
          </ul>

            How we handle data about scanned sites
          </h2>
          <p>
            A scan captures evidence — response headers, page content
            excerpts, and similar technical artifacts — needed to justify
            each finding in your report. Before this evidence is stored, any
            value that looks like a secret (an API key, token, or
            credential) is redacted; only a fingerprint of it is kept, never
            the raw value. Evidence bundles are stored for a limited period
            (90 days) and then deleted; the resulting report and score are
            retained for as long as your account exists.
          </p>
          <p>
            Passive-tier scanning only ever makes requests a normal visitor
            or search-engine crawler would make. Active-tier scanning — path
            enumeration and deeper probing — only runs once we have verified
            you own or control the target, via a DNS record, a well-known
            file, or a meta tag you control.

        <section className="space-y-2">
          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">People invited to an organisation</h2>
          <p>
            When an organisation owner or admin invites someone, we store the
            invited email address, the role offered and the inviter until the
            invitation is accepted, withdrawn or replaced. We do not currently
            email invitations: the person who invited you passes you a link.
            If you were not expecting one, ignore it: nothing happens unless
            you accept.

        <section className="space-y-2">
          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">Who we share data with</h2>
          <p>
            We use a small number of subprocessors to run the service:
            our cloud hosting and database provider, our authentication
            provider (Clerk), our merchant-of-record billing provider, and
            an LLM provider used to generate plain-language remediation
            guidance for findings. Data sent to the LLM provider is limited
            to already-redacted finding summaries — never raw evidence or
            account credentials. We do not currently use an email provider; if
            that changes we will update this policy before sending any email.
            We do not sell your data.

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">Your rights</h2>
          <p>
            You can delete your account yourself under Account in the
            console. That removes your account, the organisations you own
            and everything in them, and your sign-in. Things you created in
            someone else&apos;s organisation stay with that organisation, our
            security log keeps an anonymous record that you acted, and our
            payment provider keeps invoices it is required to keep. You can
            also request a copy of the data we hold about you, or ask us to
            correct it, by emailing{" "}
