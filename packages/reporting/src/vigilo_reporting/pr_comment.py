"""build_pr_comment_markdown(): a GitHub PR-comment rendering of a scan's
findings, for `.github/actions/scan`'s optional `post-comment` input. Pure
function, same convention as `build_report()`/`build_sarif_report()` — no
I/O, no self-fetching, every input already fetched by the caller.

A marker HTML comment (`_COMMENT_MARKER`) is prefixed to the output so the
action's upsert step can find and edit its own prior comment on a PR
instead of piling up a new one on every push — the same identity the
marker gives `build_sarif_report`'s SARIF upload for free (GitHub replaces
prior Code Scanning results for the same rule/location automatically); a
plain markdown comment has no such built-in identity, so this module has
to provide one.

Only `FAILED` findings get a table row — `PASSED`/`NOT_APPLICABLE` add no
information a reviewer needs, matching `build_sarif_report`'s own
reportable-findings filter. `INCONCLUSIVE` findings are still surfaced (as
a one-line count), never silently dropped, for the same reason
`build_sarif_report` keeps them as a `note`.
